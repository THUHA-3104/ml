This project builds a clean, leakage-safe machine learning pipeline to predict the number of completed credits (TC_HOANTHANH) for university students in the next semester.
The model leverages historical academic records, admission information, and temporal feature engineering, combined with Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to ensure interpretability.

The solution is designed for academic performance forecasting, student risk monitoring, and data-driven educational decision support.
